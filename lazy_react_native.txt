1. Tried to use android studio as react-native editor but it does not support js files
Therefore I choose intelliJ.
  - downloaded eslint seperate from internet.
  - intellij->settings->plugin I choose install plugin localy from saved file. Restarted intellij.
  - Then ran following command in window cmd terminal: E/reactnative/albums( this is my project)
    npm install --save-dev eslint-config-rallyconding
    - I had to close all AVD and Android studio and twice ran the above command.
  - To let RN project use eslint we have to create .eslintrc file in project foldr. #this needs in every project that we create in the future.

8. Start and studio , avd manger and launch android simultor.
8'. IMPORTANT:
    -  Open react native project- android file in android studio.
       IMPORTANT : We need to repeat above for every new project created in react native so that gradle is created.

     - Then enter Java environment variable and path in windows system
    - For eve
